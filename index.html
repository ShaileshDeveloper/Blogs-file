    <p> <strong>Javascript</strong> is the 2nd most demanding language out there after python according to the website <a class="link"
            href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-in-demand-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2020-4462eb7d8d3e">Towards science</a> and has gained immense popularity in today's industry culture
    , but before we go deep into <strong>Javascript</strong> ,<span> do you even know why programming languages are so important ?</span> </p>

    <p>The above program that you see is the output of (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 =55) , can you imagine how complex it would have been back then , when computing was born the way we
        have to give instructions to computer is all in <strong>0's and 1's</strong>  .
        This was the main reason why programming language was made <strong>"to interact with computers in a better and easy way" .</strong> .
    </P>

    <p>The same output of (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 =55) can be acheived nowadays with the help of programming languages just by the following <strong>code</strong>  :- </p>

    <P>Did you just see how easy programming language has made your life? ,
        with the help of <strong>functions</strong>  and <strong>loops</strong>  of a programming language , we don't have to write the same thing again and
        again , processor will do that for you .</p>

    <h4>So,lets get back to the topic <span><strong class="underline">WHY JAVASCRIPT ? </strong></span></h4>

    <p> <strong>1) Javascript</strong>  syntax's are the closest thing to <strong>"english" language</strong>  and not like other programming language
        (stdio.h ,conio.h) ,you know which language i am talking about . </p>
    <p> <strong> 2) Javascript's </strong>text editor is present in every laptop that has a <strong>web browser </strong> , can you imagine how many people
        have access to write code in javascript without downloading any software .</p>
    <p><strong>3) It</strong>  is  user friendly so <strong>(even if miss out some typos such as semicolon and all , you dont have to worry much
        about your program it will run completely fine) .</strong></p>
    <p><strong>4) Well</strong> it can be used to make <strong>native apps , websites</strong>  which are very helpful if you want to pursue career in free
        lancing .</p>

     <p>These are my reasons to choose javascript as my first language to learn</p>
    <p><strong>Well tell me your favorite reason why you chose Javascript as your "favorite" language ?</strong> </p>

<!-- Why Javascript

Do you know Javascript is the most popular language out there

<p> https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-in-demand-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2020-4462eb7d8d3e

Javascript the most popular language out ther according to the website towardsdatasccience.com.



Before we start out on why java script can you think of why even programming languages?
001010100 10010010010   1001010100 {images}


 do know you the above image that you see is the output for
 

 earlier to get the out put of 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55  we have to right the code as in the above image,imagine writing code for a big program that will be near to imposible,,

 count=1;
 total=0;
 for(count;count<=10;count++){
     total= total+count;
 }
 console.log(total);


 and this program you see write there gives the same output;


 Thats what programming language gives you ,its makes it much each easy to use it helps with different functions loops so you don't have to worry about execution of program again and again.

 There are so many programming languages out there so why i chose javascript as my first programming language;{
     1 : Its syntax is closest thing to english language not like other programming language like(stdio.h ,conio.h) you know which language i am talking about stop pretending.
     2 : Its editor is present in every laptop that has a weeb browser(can you imagine how many people have access to write code in javascript without downloading anything)
     3 : Its damn user friendly ,(even if miss out some typos such as semicolon and all , you dont have to worry much about your program it will runcompletely fine)
     4 : Many databases such as mongo DB, couchDB also uses the javascript as there scripting and query language.
     5 : Well this is the 5 and main important one tanay bhaiya said javascript he best hai;
     6 : Well it can be used to make native apps,websites which will be very helpful if you want to pursue as free lancer
